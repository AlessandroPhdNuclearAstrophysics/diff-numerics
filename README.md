# My C++ Project

This project is a simple C++ application that demonstrates the use of CMake and Makefile for building and organizing code.

## Project Structure

```
my-cpp-project
├── src                # Source files
│   └── main.cpp      # Main application entry point
├── include            # Header files
│   └── my_header.h    # Declarations for functions and classes
├── build              # Directory for build files generated by CMake
├── bin                # Directory for compiled binary executables
├── Makefile           # Makefile for building the project
├── CMakeLists.txt     # CMake configuration file
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-cpp-project
   ```

2. Run the following command to build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```

This will create the `build` and `bin` directories, run CMake in the `build` directory, and compile the source code.

## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the application from the `bin` directory:
```
./bin/my_cpp_project
```

## Dependencies

This project requires CMake and a C++ compiler to build and run. Make sure to have them installed on your system.
